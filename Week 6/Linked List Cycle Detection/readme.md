# Linked List Cycle Detection

## Problem

Given the beginning of a linked list `head`, return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if at least one node in the list can be visited again by following the next pointer.

Internally, `index` determines the index of the beginning of the cycle, if it exists. The tail node of the list will set it's next pointer to the `index`-th node. If `index = -1`, then the tail node points to `null` and no cycle exists.

**Note:** `index` is not given to you as a parameter.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4], index = 1`

**Output:** `true`

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### Example 2:

**Input:** `head = [1,2], index = -1`

**Output:** `false`

## Approach

We use a slow and a fast pointer, the slow pointer moves one step at a time and the fast one moves two steps at a time. If they eventually meet there is a cycle if not the fast pointer will reach the end and equal null.
