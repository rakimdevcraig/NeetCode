Problem:

Invert Binary Tree
You are given the root of a binary tree root. Invert the binary tree and return its root.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,2,1]

Output: [3,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []
Constraints:

0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Approach:
We're gonna swap the children of the root first, then the left side of the root all the way down, then swap all the way down the right side.
